# Subscribe to Multiple Event Types

Configure a single Subscription to receive events of multiple types.

## Prerequisites

- You have the Eventing module in your Kyma cluster.
- You have access to Kyma dashboard. Alternatively, if you prefer CLI, you need `kubectl` and `curl`.
- Optionally, you have the [CloudEvents Conformance Tool](https://github.com/cloudevents/conformance) for publishing events.
- You have an inline Function as event sink (see [Create and Modify an Inline Function](https://kyma-project.io/#/serverless-manager/user/tutorials/01-10-create-inline-function)).

> [!TIP]
> Use Istio sidecar proxies for reliability, observability, and security (see [Istio Service Mesh](https://kyma-project.io/#/istio/user/00-00-istio-sidecar-proxies)).

## Context

To subscribe to multiple events, you need a [Subscription](../resources/subscription-cr.md) custom resource (CR). The following example shows how to subscribe to events of two types: `order.received.v1` and `order.changed.v1`.

If you want to subscribe to more event types, add more types to your subscription.

## Procedure

1. Create a subscription with multiple event types.
   - In Kyma dashboard, find the default namespace, go to **Configuration** and create a Subscription with the following parameters:
      - **Subscription name**: `lastorder-sub`
      - **Types**: `order.received.v1` and `order.changed.v1`
      - **Service**: `lastorder` (the sink is populated automatically)
      - **Type matching:**: `standard`
      - **Source**: `myapp`

   - With kubectl, run: 
     ```bash
     cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
      apiVersion: eventing.kyma-project.io/v1alpha2
      kind: Subscription
      metadata:
       name: lastorder-sub
       namespace: default
      spec:
       sink: 'http://lastorder.default.svc.cluster.local'
       source: myapp
       types:
         - order.received.v1
         - order.changed.v1
     EOF
     ```

2. Verify that the subscription is ready.
   - In Kyma dashboard, the status must be `READY`.
   - Alternatively, run `kubectl get subscriptions lastorder-sub -o=jsonpath="{.status.ready}"` and see if the response is `true`.

3. Port-forward the [Eventing Publisher Proxy](../README.md#eventing-publisher-proxy) to localhost, using port `3000`:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n kyma-system port-forward service/eventing-publisher-proxy 3000:80
   ```

4. To publish the first event (type `order.received.v1`) to trigger your Function, open another terminal window:
   - With the CloudEvents Conformance Tool, run:
     ```bash
     cloudevents send http://localhost:3000/publish \
        --type order.received.v1 \
        --id cc99dcdd-6f6d-43d6-afef-d024eb276584 \
        --source myapp \
        --datacontenttype application/json \
        --data "{\"orderCode\":\"3211213\", \"orderStatus\":\"received\"}" \
        --yaml
     ```

   - With `curl`, run:
     ```bash
     curl -v -X POST \
        -H "ce-specversion: 1.0" \
        -H "ce-type: order.received.v1" \
        -H "ce-source: myapp" \
        -H "ce-eventtypeversion: v1" \
        -H "ce-id: cc99dcdd-6f6d-43d6-afef-d024eb276584" \
        -H "content-type: application/json" \
        -d "{\"orderCode\":\"3211213\", \"orderStatus\":\"received\"}" \
        http://localhost:3000/publish
     ```

5. Publish the second event (type `order.changed.v1`) to trigger your Function.
   - With the CloudEvents Conformance Tool, run:
     ```bash
     cloudevents send http://localhost:3000/publish \
        --type order.changed.v1 \
        --id 94064655-7e9e-4795-97a3-81bfd497aac6 \
        --source myapp \
        --datacontenttype application/json \
        --data "{\"orderCode\":\"3211213\", \"orderStatus\":\"changed\"}" \
        --yaml
     ```

   - With `curl`, run:
     ```bash
     curl -v -X POST \
        -H "ce-specversion: 1.0" \
        -H "ce-type: order.changed.v1" \
        -H "ce-source: myapp" \
        -H "ce-eventtypeversion: v1" \
        -H "ce-id: 94064655-7e9e-4795-97a3-81bfd497aac6" \
        -H "content-type: application/json" \
        -d "{\"orderCode\":\"3211213\", \"orderStatus\":\"changed\"}" \ 
        http://localhost:3000/publish
     ```

6. To verify that the event was delivered, check the logs of the Function.
   - In Kyma dashboard, return to the view of your `lastorder` Function and go to **Code** > **Replicas of the Function**. Select your replica and under **Containers**, view the logs.

   - With `kubectl`, run:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs \
     -n default \
     -l serverless.kyma-project.io/function-name=lastorder,serverless.kyma-project.io/resource=deployment \
     -c function
     ```

## Result

You see the received event in the logs:

```sh
Received event: { orderCode: '3211213', orderStatus: 'received' }
Received event: { orderCode: '3211213', orderStatus: 'changed' }
```
