# Eventing Resources

You configure the Eventing module by creating and applying Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD), which extend the Kubernetes API with custom additions.

- To understand and configure the module's global settings, see the [Eventing CRD](eventing-cr.md).
- To create a subscriber, define a [Subscription CRD](subscription-cr.md).
