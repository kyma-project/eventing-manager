# General Diagnostics: Event Not Delivered

## Symptom

- You publish an event, but the subscriber does not receive it.
- A Subscription custom resource (CR) is not in the `Ready` state.
- You cannot publish events, and the publisher receives an error.

## Cause

This issue can have several causes, from misconfiguration of the Eventing module or Subscription to problems with the event payload or the subscriber workload.

## Solution

Follow these steps to detect the source of the problem:

### 1. Verify that the Eventing module is healthy

1. Check the state of the Eventing CR:

   ```bash
   kubectl get eventing -n kyma-system
   ```

2. In the output, look for `STATE: Ready`. If the state is not `Ready` (for example, `Warning` or `Error`), inspect the CR's status for detailed error messages:

   ```bash
   kubectl get eventing eventing -n kyma-system -o yaml
   ```

3. To understand the issue, review the **status.conditions** and **status.state**. For common states and recommended actions, see [Eventing Module Status and Event Flow](../resources/eventing-cr.md#eventing-module-status-and-event-flow).

### 2. Check the Subscription Status

If the Eventing CR is ready, check the status of your Subscription.

1. Check if the Subscription is ready. Replace the placeholders with your values.

   ```bash
   kubectl get subscription {SUBSCRIPTION_NAME} -n {NAMESPACE}
   ```

2. In the output, look for `READY: true`. If it is `false`, inspect the Subscription's status for details:

   ```bash
   kubectl get subscription {SUBSCRIPTION_NAME} -n {NAMESPACE} -o yaml
   ```

3. Examine the **status.conditions** array for error messages. A common issue is an invalid sink, which must be a valid, reachable HTTP endpoint (for example, `http://my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`).

### 3. Check the Publisher and Event Payload

If the Subscription CR is ready, verify that you are publishing the event correctly.

After sending an event, check the HTTP response code.

- 4xx error: A client-side error indicates a problem with your request. Ensure your event conforms to the CloudEvents specification or the legacy event format. For details, see [Event Name Format](../evnt-event-names.md#event-name-format).

- 5xx error: A server-side error indicates a problem with the Eventing Publisher Proxy. Check its logs for errors:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n kyma-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=eventing-publisher-proxy
  ```

- 2xx status: Verify that the event **type** attribute in your published event exactly matches one of the types defined in your Subscription's **spec.types** field.

### 4. Check the Eventing Manager Logs

The Eventing Manager is responsible for dispatching events from the backend to the subscriber.

1. Check the logs for dispatch errors or other warnings:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kyma-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=eventing-manager
    ```

2. Look for logs related to your subscription. 
   If you use the NATS backend, a successful dispatch log contains `"message":"event dispatched"`. If this log is missing, it could mean the subscriber is unreachable or the NATS server is unavailable.

### 5. Check the Subscriber's Health

Ensure the subscriber application (the sink) is running and can receive HTTP requests.

1. Get the sink URL from your Subscription:

   ```bash
   kubectl get subscription {SUBSCRIPTION_NAME} -n {NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.spec.sink}'
   ```

2. Run a temporary curl pod inside the cluster to test connectivity to the sink. Replace **{SINK_URL}** with the output from the previous command:

   ```bash
   # Run the test
   kubectl run sink-test --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -n {NAMESPACE} -- curl -v -X POST {SINK_URL}

   # Check the logs for the HTTP response
   kubectl logs sink-test -n {NAMESPACE}

   # Clean up the pod
   kubectl delete pod sink-test -n {NAMESPACE}
   ```

If the response code is not 2xx, the problem is with your subscriber application. Check its logs to diagnose the issue.

### 6. Check the NATS Backend

If all previous steps show no errors, the issue may be within the NATS backend itself. Continue with [Troubleshooting the NATS Module](https://kyma-project.io/#/nats-manager/user/troubleshooting/03-05-nats-troubleshooting.md).
